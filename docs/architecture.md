# Market Application Architecture v1.0.0

## Overview

The Market Application is a C++-based financial system that provides comprehensive accounting and financial management capabilities. The system is designed with a modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct components while maintaining clear relationships between them.

## Core Components

### Core Module
- **Account**: Manages financial accounts and their associated wallets
- **Wallet**: Handles transactions and maintains balances
- **Transaction**: Represents financial transactions
- **Contract**: Manages financial contracts (assets and liabilities)

### Financial Module

- **Liability**: Represents financial liabilities
- **Balance**: Tracks financial balances

### Accounting Module
- **Ledger**: Maintains the general ledger
- **Journal**: Records financial transactions
- **JournalEntry**: Represents individual journal entries
- **TrialBalance**: Generates trial balance reports
- **IncomeStatement**: Generates income statements
- **CashFlowStatement**: Generates cash flow statements

### Utils Module
- **Decimal**: Handles precise decimal calculations
- **IDGenerator**: Generates unique identifiers

## Architecture Diagrams

### Component Diagram
The component diagram (`architecture.puml`) shows the relationships between different components of the system. It illustrates:
- Package structure
- Component dependencies
- Relationship types (composition, association, usage)

### Transaction Flow
The sequence diagram (`transaction_flow.puml`) demonstrates the flow of a transaction through the system:
1. Transaction creation
2. Wallet balance updates
3. Journal entry creation
4. Ledger updates

## Design Patterns

The application employs several design patterns:
- Factory Method (for object creation)
- Singleton (for ID generation)
- Observer (for balance updates)
- Command (for transactions)
